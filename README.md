# 🧭 Dashboard Chrome Extension

A minimalist Chrome extension that transforms your new tab into a personalized dashboard featuring a real-time clock, dynamic greeting, and an inspirational quote. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and bundled using **Vite** for efficient development and deployment.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Features

- 🕒 **Live Clock**: Displays the current time, updating every second.
- 👋 **Dynamic Greeting**: Personalized greeting based on the time of day (e.g., "Good Morning").
- 💬 **Inspirational Quote**: Fetches and displays a random quote to motivate users.
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Simple and responsive design for an uncluttered new tab experience.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES7+ with ES Modules and top-level await)
